🏦 Loan Eligibility Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is focused on building a machine learning model that predicts whether a loan application should be approved or not based on historical data. The goal is to automate the decision-making process and help financial institutions make faster and more accurate eligibility decisions.

📌 Project Overview

Loan eligibility prediction is a common use case in the finance sector. The project uses supervised learning techniques to train a model on labeled data (approved/rejected loans) and make predictions on new applications.

Key Features:
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature engineering
Model training and evaluation
Hyperparameter tuning
Final model deployment-ready format
📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various features such as:

Applicant's income
Co-applicant's income
